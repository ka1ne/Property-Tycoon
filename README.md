# Property-Tycoon
My main task was piping [this data](https://github.com/ka1ne/Property-Tycoon/tree/main/Assets/Resources/Data) given in CSV files into and building the game objects.  
</br>
With [this script](https://github.com/ka1ne/Property-Tycoon/blob/main/Assets/BoardScripts/BoardData.cs) I used [C#'s LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/) to query data, then utilised the [Builder Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) to create the game objects with their necessary data.

Here's the [main directory for my work](https://github.com/ka1ne/Property-Tycoon/tree/main/Assets/BoardScripts), please explore.
